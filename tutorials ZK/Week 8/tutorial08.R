# This data set is analyzed by Long (1997).  The response variable has four ordered categories:
# Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, and Strongly Agree in relation to the statement

# "A working mother can establish just as warm and secure a relationship with her children as a mother who does not work."

# The explanatory variables are:
# the year of the survey (1977 or 1989),
# the gender of the respondent,
# the race of the respondent (white or non-white),
# the respondent's age, and
# the prestige of the respondent's occupation (a quantitative variable)
